"""TensorFlow testing subclass to automate numerical testing.

  Golden tests determine when behavior deviates from some "gold standard", and
are useful for determining when layer definitions have changed without
performing full regression testing, which is generally prohibitive. This class
handles the symbolic graph comparison as well as loading weights to avoid
relying on random number generation, which can change.

The tests performed by this class are:

1) Compare a generated graph against a reference graph. Differences are not
   necessarily fatal.
2) Attempt to load known weights for the graph. If this step succeeds but
   changes are present in the graph, a warning is issued but does not raise
   an exception.
3) Perform a calculation and compare the result to a reference value.

This class also provides a method to generate reference data.

Note:
  The test class is responsible for fixing the random seed during graph
  definition. A convenience method name_to_seed() is provided to make this
  process easier.

The test class should also define a .regenerate() class method which (usually)
just calls the op definition function with test=False for all relevant tests.
